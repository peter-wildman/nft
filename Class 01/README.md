# Class 01

This class we will be focusing on the workflow of using P5.JS and how we are going to be writing our code for the semester. We'll be introduced to the software Brackets in the video and then shown how to draw simple shapes to the screen.

Please refer to the Youtube channel for all of the detail and download the code completed in those tutorials here from this repository.
